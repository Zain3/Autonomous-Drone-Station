# Autonomous-Drone-Station
Final Electrical Engineering Senior Design Project for my Computer Engineering Degree. 

The autonomous agricultural drone station will serve as a 
landing base, hangar, solar energy collector, recharging 
platform, data collector, and communication hub for a 
quadcopter drone. Agribugs and IoT4Ag are creating an 
autonomous drone system to gather agricultural data for 
research interpretation of crop health. Agribugs currently uses a 
series of off-the-shelf systems and human operators to gather the 
desired agricultural data. Complications of isolated systems, 
skilled human operation, and weather conditions limit the 
quantity and quality of data collected. Working towards a 
unified station that provides drone shelter, charging, data 
interpretation, and remote user interaction will allow for 
widespread deployment of agricultural inspection drones and 
mitigates the previously stated complications.
